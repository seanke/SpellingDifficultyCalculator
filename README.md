# Spelling Difficulty Calculator

A simple React app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that estimates the difficulty of spelling a word.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Changes pushed to `main` are built and published to GitHub Pages via a GitHub Actions workflow. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings with the **GitHub Actions** source.
