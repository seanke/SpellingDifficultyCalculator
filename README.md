# Spelling Difficulty Calculator

A simple React app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that estimates the difficulty of spelling a word. This little experiment tries to rate how challenging a word is to spell.

Check out the live demo on GitHub Pages: [https://seanke.github.io/SpellingDifficultyCalculator/](https://seanke.github.io/SpellingDifficultyCalculator/).

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:
